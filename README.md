# Cast A Spell: a Computer Vision Solution to Detect Spell Casting with Wands

> Background:

## Intro

Taking complex human gestures as input has al-
ways been difficult. Classical methods are known
to be complex and involve many components such
as infrared sensors, motion sensors, or gyroscopes,
to name a few; we aim to reduce complexity by
introducing a computer vision-based solution that
only needs an edge divide and camera.

## Installation

OS X & Linux & Windows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Description

1. Video Classification is at ./vid_cls
2. Sequence Classification is at ./seq_cls
3. Inference and profiling is at ./inference
4. Trained model parameters is at ./model_pts
5. Game control API is at ./api

## Usage example

OS X & Linux & Windows:

### Train a model

```bash
python train.py
```

### Test with Web Cam

```python
@TODO
```
