# Code generation via LLMs

> Background: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), generating code from documentation became possible. These code-writing LLMs can be applied to many fields such as generating robot policy code from human language.

## Intro

Low-level code generation is about generating sequences of code without loops, classes, and functions
Must include proper include statements and follow the syntax
Targeted code may use third-party libraries and predefined APIs
LLMs may pick up information from the prompt, e.g., coreference, conversation

## Installation

OS X & Linux & Windows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage example

OS X & Linux & Windows:

### Train a model

```bash
python train.py
```

### Test with Web Cam

```python
@TODO
```
